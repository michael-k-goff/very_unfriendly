# Very Unfriendly

Very Unfriendly is a minimalist HTML5 game.

### Instructions

It should play in the browser (tested on Chrome Version 63.0.3239.84). The objective is to get through as many screens, or reach as high a level, as you can before losing interest.

* Move: Left, Right, Up, Down arrows.
* Attack: Hover mouse over enemy.
* Once an enemy is targeted, you will automatically attack it repeatly until it dies, the lock is broken because the enemy moves too far away, or you target a different enemy.
* Don't let enemies get too close or they will attack and take away your HP. If you run out, you lose some progress.

### Hints

As you progress through the game, enemies get stronger. They not only get more HP and strength, but they get harder to target (you need to get closer to a stronger enemy to hit it, and the mouse accuracy required goes up). This effect is counteracted by gaining levels.

### Future Development

There might not be any; it depends on whether I feel like it.
